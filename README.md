This is a weather app which pulls the current weather data for the selected location and displays it on the screen for the user, changing the webpage background in accordance with the returned weather as well.

This is something I created as a way to further my working knowledge of API's and the React.js framework. The app takes the user supplied data and feeds it to the OpenWeather 'Current Weather API' and returns the weather information for the specified location.
